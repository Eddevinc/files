# **Exercise 4: Create Application Groups** 

As explained in the General Hierarchy section, Application Group is a logical grouping of applications installed on session hosts in the host pool. They are of two types: 

1. Remote App 
2. Desktop 

## **Task 1: Create Application Group**

An application group of type ‘Desktop’ was created automatically while creating the Session Host in previous exercise. Now in this task we will create a new application group of type ‘Remote App’ named *WVD-AG-01* and assign *Odl user* to it. Then we will add two applications i.e *word* and *excel* to the application group.

1. Navigate to Azure portal, then search for *Windows virtual* in search bar and select **Windows Virtual Desktop** from the suggestions.

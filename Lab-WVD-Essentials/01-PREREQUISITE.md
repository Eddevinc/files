# Pre-requisites to deploy Windows Virtual Desktop

To deploy a Windows Virtual Desktop environment, we need a pre-created domain (e.g: contoso.com) either using a Azure Active Directory Domain Services(AADDS) or by on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS). In this lab, we have used AADDS and it is pre-provisioned. The Domain name will be available in the Lab Environment Details. Your lab user account is given ‘AAD DC Administrator’ privilege, hence can be used to domain join machines later.
